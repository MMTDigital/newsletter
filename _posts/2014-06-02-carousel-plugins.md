## Introduction
I’ve got to be honest, when I’m usually hunting for a Carousel plug-in I usually just use the first one I come and then use that continuously until I come across a problem with it, I’ll then usually browse till the next one I come across.  This is done for convenience and to keep a project on target to reach its deadline but then when thinking it through, this might not meet all the requirements that I need from a carousel.

For this reason I thought this might be a good topic to write about because I’m sure there are people who feel the same as me, and it might also help when it comes to the next project I start on, which needs a Carousel.

## Summary
So what are we looking for in a carousel plug-in?

* The ability to have more than one carousel on a page, especially useful when a client is ‘carousel thirsty’
* Works responsively
* Works well with both text and images
* Flexibility when it comes to the carousel itself (don’t want to be writing additional lines of code to customise the carousel, as the plug-in should be doing this for you)
* Easy to implement
* Compatible with other jQuery tools on your website
* Supports major browsers

So what’s out there on a glance that may help out with the above: -

- [Royal 3D Carousel in JavaScript & CSS3](http://codecanyon.net/item/royal-3d-carousel/5351369) _(Do have to pay for a licence)_
- [Slick:jQuery Fully Responsive Carousel Plugin](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)
- [Everslider: Responsive jQuery Carousel Plugin](http://codecanyon.net/item/everslider-responsive-jquery-carousel-plugin/5132868) _(Do have to pay for a licence)_
- [Bx Slider](http://bxslider.com/)
- [Wow Slider](http://wowslider.com/rq/jquery-carousel/)
- [Tiny Carousel](http://baijs.com/tinycarousel/)

The majority of the above, handle the requirements (from the bullet point list), that’s not to say they are the definitive list and there’s nothing to stop you building your own Jquery Carousel plug-in, but the above should help you on your way.
