## [Make your website accessible]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility/make-your-website-accessible/)
There are lots of disabilities out there, but accessing your website should not pose an obstacle to any user. We, as 
web developers, should do all we can to make sure we can make our site as accessible as possible.

## [Responsive Images]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentations/responsive-images/)
What’s the correct approach to the responsive images conundrum? Is it the fabled **picture** element? What about

## [Automation For The Win]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/automate-all-the-things/)
