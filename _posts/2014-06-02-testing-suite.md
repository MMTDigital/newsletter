## Introduction
*As some of you may have noticed, the Batcaves' Testing Suite has been implemented, and thanks to some volunteers, beta 
tested.*

### What is it?
The Testing Suite is simply a collection of mobile devices connected to a proxy server (the Mac Mini), that allows a 
user to manipulate a single device and see those replicate across each of the other devices, which means you can 
quickly see your site across multiple browsers in their native environments.
