## Nodeschool.io
Learning a new language without a mentor is a tough task - after all, that's why schools and training courses are so 
successful. Nodeschool.io introduces an innovative solution to this challenge, by way of a 'choose your own adventure' 
set of interactive training resources for learning Node.js.

You need Node.js installed first (of course), then you download a lesson from NPM and just follow the instructions.
